## üîß Setup and Installation
Not ready for setting up my application locally yet? Then explore our [Team Project](https://landing.moneta-api.space/) first!<br>There, you will be able to have a look at Swagger documentation, my running telegram bot and my colleague's work - WebSite for the frontend done by [Maria Shmakova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariashmakova/)

Follow these steps to set up Moneta BudgetApp locally or follow steps in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUsDDkUCCTE):

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - If you want to use your **own** MySQL, update [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) directly or [envrironment variables](.env.sample) with your MySQL credentials.
        - If not, just proceed with the next step as follow-up commands are ready to start MySQL locally in docker container.
    - Having a telegram bot with /start and /stop command is **a must** for authentication. Please visit [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a bot with aforementioned commands. Use [this](BOTINSTRUCTION.md) instruction to create your bot.
    - Having a sendgrid API key or adjusting [EmailService](src/main/java/com/example/budgetingapp/services/email/EmailService.java) to use Google SMTP **is recommended** but can be ignored on condition you are okay with not being able to use email registration.
        - Having a [SendGrid account](https://sendgrid.com/en-us) **is required** if using Google SMTP is unwanted;
            - Having a spare email address to use for sendgrid **is required**;
    - Software **required**:
        - Git
        - Maven
        - Docker
    ```sh
      #check if everything is installed
      #by checking version of software
      git -v
      mvn -v
      docker -v
    ```

2. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
      #clone the repository
      git clone https://github.com/AdamMudrak/budgetapp.git
      #change to budgetapp root package
      cd budgetapp/
    ```
    ```sh
      #build application archive
      mvn clean package
    ```
    ```sh
      #build application docker image
      docker build -t budgetapp .
    ```
   ```sh
      #pull mysql docker image
      docker pull mysql:latest
    ```
    ```sh
      #run mysql docker container, save data in /var/lib/mysql
      docker run --name mysql-container \
        -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
        -e MYSQL_DATABASE=moneta_db \
        -e MYSQL_USER=moneta_user \
        -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=moneta_pass \
        -p 3307:3306 -v mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql
    ```
    - Adjusting [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) directly or [envrironment variables](.env.sample) **required**:
        - TELEGRAM_TOKEN - provide Bot API Token to enable telegram authentication
    - **Recommended**, but app will start without them:
        - JWT_SECRET - secure your JWTs
        - EMAIL_SECRET - secure your email links with a random string
        - REGISTRATION_CONFIRMATION_LINK
        - PASSWORD_RESET_CONFIRMATION_LINK
        - GET_RANDOM_PASSWORD_REDIRECT_LINK
        - ORIGINS_ALLOWED
        - SENDGRID_API_KEY - key required to enable [EmailService](src/main/java/com/example/budgetingapp/services/email/EmailService.java)
        - MAIL_ADDRESS - your spare mail address used and verified on [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us)
    ```sh
      #run application using .env.sample
      docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env.sample budgetapp
    ```

    - Navigate to [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/) for API exploration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced & Solutions
Building Moneta BudgetApp presented some interesting challenges:
- **Security Implementation:** Managing JWT-based authentication for access, refresh, and action tokens required deep integration with Spring Security. Since I had only worked with access tokens before, implementing refresh and action tokens was a new challenge that demanded thorough research and deep learning.
- **Telegram Bot Authentication:** Configuring the Telegram bot to work seamlessly with our authentication system required careful API handling. As I was unfamiliar with the Telegram API, I had to explore its documentation extensively to ensure a secure and efficient integration.
- **Email Handling with SendGrid:** Setting up email-based password recovery and support requests while ensuring security and reliability. Working with the SendGrid API and Spring Email for the first time required an in-depth study of their capabilities to implement a robust and secure email system.

Despite these challenges, overcoming them made the journey incredibly rewarding!
